This project is a software implementation for a car service station using Object-Oriented Programming in Java. 
The software provides different types of services for different types of cars and generates a detailed bill based on the type of car and requested service codes.

## Tech Used
* Java 8 and above

## Features:

* Car Types :- The car service station caters to three types of cars: Hatchback, Sedan and SUV.
* Services :- The software provides the following types of services:</br>
1. Basic Service (Service Code: BS01)</br>
2. Engine Fixing (Service Code: EF01)</br>
3. Clutch Fixing (Service Code: CF01)</br>
4. Brake Fixing (Service Code: BF01)</br>
5. Gear Fixing (Service Code: GF01)</br>
 * Pricing: Each service has a specific service code associated with it and different prices for each car type. The prices are as follows:

|   Service Code	| Service  	        |   Hatchback Price	|  Sedan Price 	|   SUV Price	|
|---	            |---	              |---	              |---	          |---	        |
|  BS01 	        |  Basic Servicing 	|   2000	          |  4000	        |  5000 	    |
|   	 EF01       |   Engine Fixing 	|   5000	          |  8000 	      |   10000	    |
|   CF01	        |  Clutch Fixing   	|   2000	          |  4000 	      |   6000	    |
|   BF01	        |   Break Fixing  	|   1000	          |  1500         |   2500	    |
|   GF01        	|   	Gear Fixing   |    3000         	|  6000         |   8000    	|


## Usage:

* When the program starts, it will display a welcome message and provide two options: selecting a car or exiting the program.

* Choose option 1 to select a car for servicing.

* Select the type of car you want to servicing by entering the corresponding number.

* Once the car type is selected, you will be prompted to choose from a list of service codes.

* Enter the number corresponding to the desired service code to add it to your service list.

* Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add more services or choose option 6 to generate the bill.

* The bill will be displayed, showing the details of the selected services and the total bill amount.

* If you want to select another car for servicing, choose option 1 again. Otherwise, choose option 2 to exit the program.
